# Introduction #

The ICARUS Jet is a QuadTiltJet UAV.  It includes 4 tilt-able Turbine Engines to provide high efficiency Hover and high-speed Forward flight modes.


# Tasks #
## Critical ##
  1. Develop control concepts/equations for Hover, Transition and Forward flight modes.
  1. Develop simulation of UAV in V-Rep for control loop tuning/debugging. (INW)
  1. Develop Evolution Algorithm controller for controlling Engine Power and Rotation angles.
  1. Develop mechanical design for efficient aerodynamic flight and resilient takeoff/landing maneuvers.
  1. Develop software for resilient operation/failure modes.

## Regular ##
  1. Optic Flow to measure velocity over ground, used for auto-landing.
  1. Obstacle Avoidance using forward-facing camera
  1. Perform system identification on turbine engine for automated control loop tuning.
  1. Design Tilt Mechanism
