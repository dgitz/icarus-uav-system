# Summary #
This page documents the overall design of the ICARUS Jet.

# Design Goals #
Range: 5 Miles

Cruise Speed: 60 miles/hour (88 feet/second)

Flight Time: At least 25 minutes

Duty Cycle:

Hover: 15%,Transition: 5%, Cruise: 85%

# Version 1 #
## Revision B ##
v1RevB is designed to operate via standard electric brushless motors.  Due to the cost of the relevant turbine engines it will be advantageous to prototype the airframe with much less costly components.
### Fuselage Airfoil ###
Airfoil: NACA 0020

Chord Length: 24"
## Revision A ##
v1RevA is somewhat of a conceptual model, designed to provide the overall design concepts of the ICARUS Jet and validate the different software involved.
