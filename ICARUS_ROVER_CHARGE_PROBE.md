The Charging Probe is designed as a a 4-bar linkage actuated by a winch motor that will (eventually) contain a standard male AC plug for recharging the ICARUS Rover.  Currently the Charging Probe is made of Lego's, and may be re-designed with 3d printed materials if the structure is inadequate.

The reason for the interesting shape of the Charging Probe is due to the physical constraints of the ICARUS Rover.
