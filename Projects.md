# Introduction #
This page contains a collection of Projects I am working on to support the ICARUS System.  At some point, I intend on entering the ICARUS QTR system into some form of advanced UAV competition, and hopefully these projects will help me earn 1st place.

# Projects #
## ROS, APM and Kinect ##
[APM, ROS and Kinect](ROS_APM_KINECT.md)

This project was for the UIC ECE 452 Project, but I made the project suitable for the ICARUS System.  This is currently a "finished" project, although I'm sure there is much more work to be done with it.

## APM Tester ##
[APM Tester](APM_Tester.md)

This project is to validate the precision and accuracy of the DIYDrones APM 2.0 using a PUMA Robot.

## SLAM ##
[SLAM](ICARUS_SLAM.md)

This project is used to provide indoor GPS-like navigation to a flying quadcopter with the Microsoft Kinect and the ROS package RGBDSLAM.  Again this is currently a "finished" project, although I'm sure there is much more work to be done with it.

## Obstacle Avoidance ##
[Obstacle avoidance](ICARUS_OBSTACLE_AVOIDANCE.md)

This project is used to perform obstacle avoidance on a quadcopter using Ultrasonic Sensors, a Microsoft Kinect and AI algorithms.

## Target Detection ##
[Target Detection](TargetDetection.md)

This project is used to perform target detection in an unknown environment using Neural Networks.

## ICARUS Modeling ##
[Modeling](ICARUS_MODEL.md)
