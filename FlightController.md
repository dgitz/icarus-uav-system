# Flight Controller #

[Source Code](https://github.com/dgitz/icarus_fc)

# Introduction #

The Flight Controller is based on an DIYDrones APM 2.0 running the ArduCopter code.  The Flight Controller is used as a COTS device, i.e. the source code is not modified at all.  This is due to the huge support community of DIYDrones that is constantly developing this software.
