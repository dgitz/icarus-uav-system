== Variable Declarations ==

 * All collections of objects should end with an 's':
{{{ 
Obstacles(1).Index 
SonarSensors(4).CurrentAngle
}}}
 * When indexing a collection of objects the indexing parameter should be the first letter in the collection name:
{{{
Obstacles(o).Index
SonarSensors(s).CurrentAngle
}}}
 * All EA Tuned Parameters/User Inputs should be in all CAPITALS, with each word separated by an underscore:
{{{
BUCKET_ITEMS
TEST_VEHICLE_RANDOM_WALK
}}}
 * All Functions/Scripts should be in CamelCase with no separation between words:
{{{
TestOccupancyGrid
BuildEnvironment('SmallObstacles')
}}}
 * All other variables should be in CamelCase with underscores separating words:
{{{
Sensor_In_Sight
In_Overlap
}}}
 * All variables in a Function that are similar to global variables shall be preceeded by 'my_':
{{{
my_OccupancyGrid
my_SonarSensors
}}}
