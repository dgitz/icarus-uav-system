# Introduction #
The ICARUS Flyer is a QuadRotor helicopter based on a 3DR Arducopter that has been heavily modified to allow for safer operation indoors and much higher computational capabilities.

The objective of the ICARUS Flyer is to provide autonomous navigation of an indoor environment by visually identifying objects and building waypoints based on what types of objects it identifies.

As this is an indoor quadrotor, obstacle avoidance is required to mitigate damage to the UAV, its environment and other persons nearby.

# Features #
  * Weight:
  * T/W Ratio:
  * Normal Run-Time (w/o additional payload):
  * Payload Capacity:
  * Obstacle Avoidance based on a [Force Mapping process](https://code.google.com/p/icarus-uav-system/wiki/ICARUS_OBSTACLE_AVOIDANCE) using 6 Ultrasonic Sensors.
# Current Status #
Currently the ICARUS Flyer is in development stages.  Obstacle Avoidance is being implemented along with the visual identification tasks.
